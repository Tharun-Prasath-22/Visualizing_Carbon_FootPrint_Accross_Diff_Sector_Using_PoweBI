# Visualizing-Carbon-Footprints-Across-Sectors-Using-Power-BI
Project Overview
This project uses Power BI to create an interactive dashboard that visualizes carbon emissions across different sectors such as energy, transportation, agriculture, and manufacturing. The goal is to make it easier to analyze and compare carbon footprints, helping users make data-driven decisions for sustainability.

Problem Statement
Understanding carbon emissions across sectors can be complex due to scattered data and a lack of clear visual representation. This project aims to bring together emissions data from different sectors in a single Power BI dashboard, simplifying analysis and comparison.

Solution
An interactive Power BI dashboard that consolidates sector-wise carbon emission data into one platform. Users can explore trends, compare sectors, and gain insights through dynamic visualizations and filters.

Tools & Technologies Used
Power BI: Main tool for visualization and dashboard creation.

Excel: Used for data cleaning and preprocessing.

DAX: Custom calculations and insights.

Power Query: Data transformation and preparation.

Online Data Sources: Carbon emission data from reliable platforms.

How to Use
Clone this repository:

bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/Tharun-Prasath-22/Visualizing_Carbon_FootPrint_Accross_Diff_Sector_Using_PoweBI.git
